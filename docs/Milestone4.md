# Milestone 4


### What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?

Our changes includes fixing bugs of the table, improving line chart, changing layout of "Help" tab, ..., and adding help text.

##### Fixing Bugs of table

After the last milestone we realized that generating the new table create a bug for a handful of cities due to the number of rows. We were able to fix this by updating the cleaning script by removing all 2015 entries, since we weren't using the 2015 values because we noticed this data was messy then this just helped to make our data file cleaner and smaller. During this we also noticed a 2 to 3 cities were out of
alphabetical order from a step in our data cleaning so this was corrected so the cities displayed properly.

##### Improving line chart

The original line chart is generated by `ggplot2`. In this milestone, we changed it to a `plotly` graph which is interactive. As users hover over lines, they can get tooltips.

Another improvement is we fixed the colors of the lines. Since we used the check box to decide which lines are displaying on the graph, the colors changed when we add or remove an item. Fixing the colors make the graph more consistent.

##### Changing Layout of "Help" tab

"Help" tab used to have a sidebar layout as the two main panels. We remove the layout and put the instructions in the middle of the page, and adjusted the font size. This improves the design of the app.


#### If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?




#### What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?

There were a few final design items that we were not able to do due to the difficulty/time constrainsts. We would like to have
