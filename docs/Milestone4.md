# Milestone 4


### What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?

For milestone 4 our team chose to make several minor improvements to our app. These improvements included fixing a bug that was created from changing the layout of our table, improving the design of the line chart, changing the layout of the Help tab, and ______.

##### Fixing Bugs of table
In milestone 3 we changed the layout of the table on the Single City tab from displaying only a single year to displaying all the years in a scrollable table. The new layout created a bug in ten of the cities that caused the table to throw an error instead of properly rendering. This issue was noticed after milestone 3 and we felt this was an important task to focus on as it effects the general usability of the app. We determined that it was a data cleaning issue that was causing the bug and thus a relatively easy thing to fix. This was a very helpful task as it helped to clean our data even further and to slightly reduce the size of data file. During this process we also noticed three of our cities were out of alphabetical order due to some renaming we did during our data cleaning and so we were also able to rectify this issue.

##### Improving line chart
The original line chart was generated by `ggplot2` and for this milestone we changed it to a `plotly` graph. Changing our plot to `plotly` greatly increases the level on interaction our user can have with the plot as they can now hover to see specific values, zoom in on ranges and interact with the plot in other ways.
During milestone 3 we changed how users interacted with our line plot by allowing the user to select the crime types with a checkbox instead of a dropdown, this was a great improvement as the user could now select which crime types they wanted to display on the plot. This new implementation caused a visual issue because when another crime was selected it would re-colour all of the lines which was not intuitive and could lead to confusion. We wanted to correct this and did so by setting the colours of each crime type to a specific colour, so now when you select aggravated assault the line is always green. We also selected colours from the colour brewer palette as we wanted to choose colours that are visually appealing and easy to difference between.


##### Changing Layout of Help tab
In milestone 3 we added a Help tab to make our app more descriptive and easier to use. We didn't really like the design of the layout which had a empty sidebar and had the text in the main layout portion. We changed the design so the text was centred and incresed the font size. This changed the Help tab more visually appealing and easier to read.

#### If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?
Our team did a good job of writing a reasonable proposal and sticking to our usage cases. We spent a lot of time in the beginning thinking about our usage cases and then translating that to operations we knew we had the skill set to achieve. This was very valuable as our group did not encounter any larger issues during implementation and ensured that our app was designed with a purpose. During the feedback session some of the other groups seemed to struggle with this more where they made great visuals but lacked some degree of purpose, we think our project flowed so easily because of how much time we spent on the design before even starting to code.

For this app specifically one thing we could have done differently is adding another tab that did a state level comparison. We designed our app to start at a national scale and then be able to filter down to the details of a specific city. It would have been interesting to add a tab in between the national and city level to have a state level comparison, then you could see how your city ranks within your own state. This would have fit within our usage cases in terms of our app appealing to decision makers at various levels of government.



#### What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?
There were a few design items that we were not able to achieve due to the difficulty of the task and the project time constraints.
1.
We wanted to change the way the time slide bar appeared which was something we received during the feedback session, currently as you move the bar back and forth it highlights the portion behind the selecting circle. We would like to have this highlight removed so it is more intuitive that you are selecting a single value instead of a range but this was something we could not figure out how to change. The slide bar widget didn't have an option to change this portion and so we would have had to write our own function to create a more personalized widget for our task.
2.
We wanted to add the population bars to the legend on the plot in the Single City tab but was not able to implement this. This seemed to be a simple task but we were not able to create a legend with the look we wanted. We feel we dealt with this as best as we could by giving the user the ability to select the items individually and thus they can see the item being drawn when after they click the corresponding box as well as adding the hover option allows them to quickly determine what the bars are. We feel we were able to make minor changes to our general design to make this less of an issue.
