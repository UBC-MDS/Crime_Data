# Milestone 3

### Reflection on the usefulness of the feedback you received

The feedback session was very insightful and helpful in updating our app to be more user
friendly. Before going into the feedback session we knew there were some bugs
with our app but it was interesting to have people find new issues. We were able
to use the feedback session to improve our app visually and functionally.

##### General Feedback
The feedback for our app was very positive. People generally found our app intuitive
and easy to use.


##### Map Tab
With the Map tab a consistent piece of feedback we received was having
the single city drop down widget present when it didn't change the map, this was a known
issue before the feedback session and was not surprising that users found this frustrating.
A piece of feedback that we received from several reviewers was the year slide bar widget looked like a range
which was something we did not expect users to say. This piece of feedback was very helpful as we realized our design wasn't as intuitive as
we had thought. We had a few suggestions to changes the style of our crime rate
circles on the map. Another piece of consistent feedback was providing more
info about crime rate circles by adding more detail to the tool tip and to add a scale to the
circle size. We found users didn't know you could click on the circles to find out the city name.

##### Single City
For the Single City tab the main piece of feedback was about removing the widget that didn't change anything on the tab.
We received comments about our plot not displaying when the tab was first selected and several of our reviewers commented on being confused about
the bars on the plot.



### Reflection on how your project has changed since Milestone 2, and why

Our app has become more functional and visually appealing since Milestone 2. We felt the feedback was very helpful in shaping our app to be better.
We added an Help tab to contain information about the data set and to provide simple instructions on how to use the app.

We removed the widgets on each tab that didn't function, which meant removing the
select a city widget from the Map tab. We tried to changed the style of the year slider since in our feedback session
several reviews thought it was displaying a range, but we were not able to find a way to style it differently. We updated the Map tab
so when you hover over the city it display the values for the crime rates and the city names, which is much more intuitive then clicking and gives the user an idea of the scale. We did change the style
 of the circles on the map by making them more transparent so you can see overlapping data better.

On the Single City tab we removed the year slider widget and changed the crime type from a dropdown widget to check-box widget to make the plot more interactive, we are also hoping this will help solve
some of the confusion around the style we have chosen to display population. During the feedback session we received lots of feedback about
placing population on a separate plot but we did not do this as we wanted population and the crime rates together so the user
can easily see if the crime rates are changing due to changes in the population. We are hoping the new style of selecting population and having it interactively drawn on the plot will help to solve the confusion users had. We were surprised we
didn't receive more feedback on the table but found people barely even noticed the table. So we made changes to make
it stand out more. We improved the overall design appeal of our app by adding a theme and increasing the font sizes.
